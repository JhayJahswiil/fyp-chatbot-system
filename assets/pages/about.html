                <h4>Project Description</h4>

                <p>The Student Project Supervisor Recommendation System is a cutting-edge solution designed to
                    revolutionize the process
                    of allocating project supervisors to students in educational institutions. This advanced system
                    utilizes
                    state-of-the-art technology and intelligent algorithms to streamline and enhance the supervisor
                    recommendation process. </p>

                <h4>Objectives</h4>

                <p>The primary objectives of our project are as follows:

                <ul>
                    <li><b>1. Efficiency and Time Savings:</b> The manual allocation of project supervisors can be a
                        time-consuming
                        and cumbersome
                        task. Our system aims to automate and expedite this process, significantly reducing the
                        administrative
                        burden and saving
                        valuable time for both students and staff.</li>
                    <li><b>2. Personalized Supervisor Matching:</b> Finding the most suitable project supervisor is
                        vital for
                        the
                        success of student
                        projects. Our system employs sophisticated algorithms that take into account various factors,
                        such
                        as
                        the project topic,
                        supervisor expertise, availability, and past performance. This ensures personalized and optimal
                        matches,
                        enhancing the
                        learning experience for students.</li>
                    <li><b>3. Enhanced Collaboration and Support:</b> Effective collaboration between students and
                        supervisors
                        is
                        crucial for
                        project success. Our system facilitates seamless communication and interaction between students
                        and
                        their assigned
                        supervisors, fostering a supportive and productive working relationship.</li>
                    <li><b>4. Fairness and Transparency:</b> Our recommendation system ensures fairness and transparency
                        in the
                        allocation process.
                        By leveraging objective criteria and unbiased algorithms, we eliminate biases and favoritism,
                        ensuring
                        equal
                        opportunities for all students to receive appropriate supervision.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Technologies Used</h4>
                <p>The project harnesses the power of the following technologies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1. Microsoft Power Virtual Agent (PVA)</b>: We have integrated our recommendation system into
                        a
                        user-friendly chat-based
                        interface using Microsoft Power Virtual Agent. This intuitive interface allows students to
                        effortlessly
                        provide their
                        project topics and receive supervisor recommendations.</li>
                    <li><b>2. SharePoint</b>: We utilize SharePoint as a centralized database to store crucial
                        information
                        about
                        project
                        supervisors, including their areas of expertise, qualifications, and availability. This data is
                        seamlessly accessed and
                        processed by our system to generate accurate supervisor recommendations.</li>
                    <li><b>3. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:</b> The frontend of our system is built using the trifecta of
                        web
                        technologies: HTML, CSS,
                        and JavaScript. This ensures a visually appealing and responsive user interface, offering an
                        immersive
                        experience to
                        students interacting with the recommendation system.</li>
                    <li><b>4. Sass:</b> We leverage the power of Sass to streamline our CSS workflow and enhance code
                        maintainability. With features
                        like variables, mixins, and nesting, Sass allows us to write clean and modular stylesheets,
                        making
                        it
                        easier to manage
                        the visual aspects of our application.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Limitations</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1. Restricted to Computer Science Department:</b> Currently, our system is limited to the
                        Computer Science Department of Ekiti
                        State University. It has been tailored to address the specific needs and requirements of this
                        department. However, there
                        is potential for future expansion to include other departments and disciplines within the
                        university.</li>
                    <li><b>2. Dependency on Project Topics:</b> The accuracy and effectiveness of supervisor
                        recommendations heavily rely on the quality
                        and specificity of the project topics provided by students. If students provide vague or
                        incomplete project topics, the
                        system may not be able to generate optimal supervisor matches.</li>
                    <li><b>3. Lack of Human Judgment:</b> While our system utilizes intelligent algorithms, it lacks the
                        human judgment and intuition that
                        can be present in manual supervisor allocation. Some factors, such as personal rapport and
                        mentoring style, may not be
                        fully captured by the system.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr>

                <p>By harnessing these cutting-edge technologies, our Student Project Supervisor Recommendation System
                    optimizes the
                    allocation process, facilitates personalized matches, and fosters a collaborative environment,
                    ultimately empowering
                    students to excel in their project endeavors.</p>
